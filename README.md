# x25: arXiv â†’ ar5iv

Adds a handy link to all arXiv papers to go to their ar5iv HTML view. 

ar5iv is still viable (even after arxiv introduced their [experimental HTML beta](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html)) because these only seem to exist for newer papers (and they might go through the backlog at some point in the future making this obsolete but that time is not now).

There exists another extension [arxiv--ar5iv](https://github.com/HannesGitH/arxiv--ar5iv) but it redirects all arxiv pdf links to ar5iv html links... which is not always desirable, I need to open both HTML and PDF.

Thus, this 10 line extension simply adds a link on the abstract page of arxiv articles that leads to ar5iv.

## Update: Link is now gradient-ified
Well... it looks good (and I mostly forget that I dont have to click on the PDF link every time)
That is the latest release, if you feel it is distracting you can download [the first release](https://github.com/plutonium-239/x25/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
